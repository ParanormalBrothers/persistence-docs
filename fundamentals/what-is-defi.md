# What is DeFi

Decentralised Finance, or DeFi, is an umbrella term describing open financial products and services that aim to provide an alternative to those offered by [centralised](https://academy.stakedao.org/what-is-a-centralised-market/) institutions like banks, credit unions, or insurance funds.

In practice, DeFi enables anyone with an internet connection to access financial services including [borrowing, lending](https://academy.stakedao.org/how-do-lending-and-borrowing-work-in-defi/), and trading, without the restrictions they would experience using a trusted (centralised) institution.

DeFi not only provides an alternative to traditional finance, but it increasingly seeks to rethink the way people interact with money, offering lower-cost, faster, and more flexible products and services.

These services are typically accessible via applications built on top of decentralised protocols (blockchains), and are known as [Dapps](https://academy.stakedao.org/what-are-dapps/) (decentralised apps).

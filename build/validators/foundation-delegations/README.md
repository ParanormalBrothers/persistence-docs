# Foundation Delegations

On 07/12/2022, the Persistence Foundation has announced a new Foundation Delegation Program.&#x20;

The Persistence Foundation Delegation Program, starting with [Round 1](round-1.md), will void and replace all previous Delegation Programs. Existing foundation delegations might be removed and redelegated based on the governance and community participation.&#x20;

## Objectives

The goals of the new Persistence Foundation Delegation Program are:&#x20;

* Further decentralise the Persistence Network (spin down foundation nodes, facilitate new validator onboarding)&#x20;
* Increase the Nakamoto Coefficient (distribute stake more evenly)&#x20;
* Improve ecosystem documentation, support and tooling by encouraging validator ecosystem contributions&#x20;
* Improve the Persistence Testnet setup and participation

## Rounds

The Foundation Delegation Program will iterate through continuous rounds, which can last anywhere between 4 to 12 weeks. Indicative timelines for the first 3 rounds are:&#x20;

| Round   | Application deadline  | Delegation period       |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Round 1 | 30/12/2022 - 23.59UTC | 13/01/2023 - 31/03/2023 |
| Round 2 | 17/03/2023 - 23.59UTC | 01/04/2023 - 30/06/2023 |
| Round 3 | 16/06/2023 - 23.59UTC | 01/07/2023 - 30/09/2023 |

The criteria and Calculation Methods are subject to change from round to round, depending on the current state and requirements of the persistence ecosystem as defined by the foundation, with inputs from the community.&#x20;

## Criteria & Delegations

The criteria and delegations are split up into 4 parts:&#x20;

* Baseline criteria
* Bonus criteria
  * for mainnet contributions
  * for testnet contributions
  * for community contributions
  * for other contributions

## Calculations

For every round, the Persistence Foundation has reserved a specific amount of XPRT, which will be split into 2 parts:&#x20;

#### Amount reserved for baseline delegations

This amount of XPRT will be evenly distributed amongst all validators who have applied to the round and who meet the baseline criteria.&#x20;

#### Amount reserved for bonus delegations

This amount of XPRT will be distributed amongst the validators based on a point scoring system. The Foundation will attribute points to contributions based on the perceived value towards the ecosystem. The reserved amount will then be delegated across bonus contributors, weighted based on the earned points. For contributions which are not recurring (e.g. a blog post), the points attributed will gradually decrease over time.

## Exclusions & Adjustments

The Foundation reserves the right to exclude any validators and remove delegations without prior warning and without justification when it deems it necessary (non-responsiveness, jailed, low uptime, etc).&#x20;

The Foundation reserves the right to make adjustments to the delegations of validators who are part of the active set for stkXPRT (by pSTAKE) in order to avoid centralisation.&#x20;

The Foundation reserves the right to make additional delegations for extra-ordinary contributions without disclosing said contribution.&#x20;

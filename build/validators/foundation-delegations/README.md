# Foundation Delegations

The Persistence Foundation Delegation Program -launched in December 2022- is designed to improve the health of the Persistence network and the overall ecosystem by supporting contributing validators in the form of foundation delegations.&#x20;

## Objectives

The goals of the new Persistence Foundation Delegation Program are:&#x20;

* Further decentralise the Persistence Network (distribute stake more evenly across validators, countries, ISPs) & make the network more robust.
* Improve ecosystem documentation, connectivity, tooling and support by encouraging validator ecosystem contributions&#x20;
* Improve the Persistence Testnet setup and participation

## Rounds

The Foundation Delegation Program will iterate through continuous rounds, which can last anywhere between 4 to 12 weeks. **Updated indicative** timelines for the first 3 rounds are:&#x20;

| Round                               | Application deadline  | Delegation period       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [Round 1](round-1.md) (CLOSED)      | 30/12/2022 - 23.59UTC | 20/01/2023 - 19/04/2023 |
| [Round 2](round-2.md) (In progress) | 07/04/2023 - 23.59UTC | 20/04/2023 - 19/07/2023 |
| Round 3                             | 16/06/2023 - 23.59UTC | 20/07/2023 - 19/10/2023 |

The criteria and calculation methods are subject to change from round to round, depending on the current state and requirements of the persistence ecosystem as defined by the foundation, with inputs from the community.&#x20;

## Criteria & Delegations

The criteria and delegations are split up as follows:

* Baseline criteria
* Bonus criteria
  * for mainnet contributions
  * for testnet contributions
  * for community contributions
  * for other contributions

## Calculations

For every round, the Persistence Foundation has reserved an amount of XPRT, which will be split into 2 parts:&#x20;

#### Amount reserved for baseline delegations

This amount of XPRT will be evenly distributed amongst all validators who have applied to the round and who meet the baseline criteria.&#x20;

#### Amount reserved for bonus delegations

This amount of XPRT will first be split into 4 unequal amounts, depending on the category of bonus contribution and the weight given to each of them. These amounts will then be distributed amongst the validators based on a point scoring system for each category. The Foundation will attribute points to contributions based on the perceived value towards the ecosystem. The reserved amount will then be delegated across bonus contributors, weighted based on the earned points. For contributions which are not recurring (e.g. a blog post), the points attributed will gradually decrease over time.

Note that validators need to meet the baseline requirements at all times in order to be eligible for any bonus delegations.

## Terms & Conditions

The Foundation reserves the right to exclude any validators and remove delegations without prior warning and without justification when it deems it necessary (non-responsiveness, jailed, low uptime, etc).&#x20;

The Foundation reserves the right to make adjustments to the delegations of validators who are or will be part of the active set for stkXPRT (by pSTAKE) in order to avoid centralisation.&#x20;

The Foundation reserves the right to make additional delegations for extra-ordinary contributions without disclosing said contribution.&#x20;

# Validator Communication

To improve coordination and interactions between the Persistence team and the validators when required, the following channels are used.&#x20;

## Your preferences

As the Persistence chain is secured by a global decentralised set of validators, the core-1 team tries to plan chain upgrades at days and times which work for the majority of the validators. Besides, we also try to take into account everyone's communication preferences. Therefore, if you are a validator on the Persistence Chain, [please fill in this form to share your preferences](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesA6IbAW5QV0zKz0yOKdwc9aeyZyzRolms7oAbkXalNQjp5w/viewform).&#x20;

## Monitoring

We recommend validators to set up their own monitoring tools and alerts to avoid any downtime. In absence of your own monitoring tools, we suggest using the tool made available by Paranormal Brothers:&#x20;

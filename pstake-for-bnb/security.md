# Security

pSTAKE has been designed with a security-first approach, with the stkBNB [smart contracts](broken-reference) thoroughly audited by multiple security-audit firms. The smart contracts audits by **Halborn** and **Peckshield** have already been concluded. The most critical smart contracts rules for pSTAKE have been verified by **Certora**. pSTAKE is working with **Forta** to set up an on-chain tracking of events to detect suspicious activity on the product. The integration will be live from the first week of launch. To learn more, view:

# Rewards & Fees

Staking rewards are received for delegating BNB to a whitelisted set of Binance Chain validators. Validators take their cut from rewards before sharing it to the protocol as claimable tokens. The rewards earned are split into two parts:

* **100% goes to stkBNB holders** in the form of stkBNB value appreciation: stkBNB holdersâ€™ share of the BNB pool keeps increasing due to the increase in the stkBNB/BNB exchange-rate.
* **0% goes to the protocol (first 3 months)**. The protocol fee is managed by a contract, and is targeted towards developmental activities like hackathons, grants, bug bounties, etc. to support long-term growth of the pSTAKE ecosystem.

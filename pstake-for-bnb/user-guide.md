### Staking[¶](broken-reference) <a href="#staking" id="staking"></a>

* Visit the [Mainnet Application](https://bnb.pstake.finance/) and connect your wallet (Metamask / Trust Wallet / Binance Web Wallet / MathWallet) If you are on a different network, you may be prompted to switch to the correct one. Click the correct network on the page, then allow it to switch.
* Open the **Staking page** from the left pane
* On the Staking page, you will see two tabs - **Stake** and **Unstake**
* Select the **Stake tab** and enter the amount of BNB you would like to liquid stake, and then click on the **Stake button** at the bottom
* Confirm the transaction on your wallet
* pSTAKE will issue stkBNB to the user’s wallet based on the exchange rate (you can see the on-going exchange rate in the Stake tab)
* The user can then use stkBNB to generate additional DeFi yields, based on available opportunities
* Staking rewards are distributed to the users in form of an increased stkBNB/BNB exchange-rate, after deducting certain fees

If you don't see your stkBNB balance in your wallet, do the following:\
\* Visit stkBNB Coingecko page\
\* Copy token address\
\* Insert the token address directly into your wallet (e.g. MetaMask)

* Users can claim their BNB by performing a claim transaction after 15 days once the BNB is available to claim. The “Claim” button is present on the left pane on the bottom side

# Ethereum

The transition from Ethereum 1.0 to 2.0 (otherwise known as “The Merge”) is expected to have a major impact on the entire cryptocurrency space, bringing more scalability and efficiency to the largest smart contract platform by market cap.

The move to PoS consensus is now setting the stage for the next phase in Ethereum’s life cycle. Greater scalability, security, and efficiency are anticipated to result from the upgrade, all of which are poised to encourage further utility and drive the adoption of not only the Ethereum network and ETH but also ETH liquid staking.



## stkETH&#x20;

As previously noted, the next addition to pSTAKE’s liquid staking ecosystem will be stkETH, the liquid staked representation of ETH. This means that ETH holders will be able to stake their tokens via [pSTAKE](https://pstake.finance/) in order to earn staking rewards whilst being issued stkETH.

Once a user acquires stkETH in their wallet, these tokens can then be used to pursue other DeFi opportunities across the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Liquidity pools, borrowing-lending use cases, and much more.

Moreover, the emergence of stkETH gives ETH stakers an added benefit of instant access to liquidity and an enhancement of the native token’s utility.

**Good to know:** depending on the product you're building, it can be useful to explicitly document use cases. Got a product that can be used by a bunch of people in different ways? Maybe consider splitting it out!

# $PSTAKE

$PSTAKE is the **governance and incentivization/dis-incentivization token** of the pSTAKE protocol. $PSTAKE holders can participate in the protocol’s governance to contribute to its long-term success by staking $PSTAKE via the pSTAKE staking contract, securing the protocol while being incentivized to do so. Learn more about $PSTAKE [here](https://blog.pstake.finance/2021/09/09/introducing-pstake/).

Additionally, $PSTAKE will be used to **incentivise adoption and integrations of pSTAKE’s stkASSETs** with DeFi protocols, while enabling new innovative use-cases.

**Good to know:** depending on the product you're building, it can be useful to explicitly document use cases. Got a product that can be used by a bunch of people in different ways? Maybe consider splitting it out!

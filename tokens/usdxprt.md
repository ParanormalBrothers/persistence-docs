# $XPRT

**$XPRT**, **the native staking token** of the [Persistence Core-1 chain](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence), was launched in April 2021 with the vision to fuel a DeFi ecosystem creating innovative use-cases beyond the traditional DeFi primitives we see on most ecosystems today.

$XPRT will **support growth at the Persistence ecosystem level** by encouraging the development of innovative stkASSET-focused dApps within the Persistence ecosystem. Builders will be incentivised to develop new use-cases leveraging the Persistence Core-1 chain infrastructure through any of the modular, smart-contract or app-chain approaches.

With the growth of DeFi opportunities within and outside the Persistence ecosystem, the adoption of stkASSETs will also grow through increased traction. This will in turn propel pSTAKEâ€™s TVL and help accrue value to both $XPRT and $PSTAKE.

**Good to know:** depending on the product you're building, it can be useful to explicitly document use cases. Got a product that can be used by a bunch of people in different ways? Maybe consider splitting it out!

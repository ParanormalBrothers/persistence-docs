As the Persistence chain runs on a delegated Proof-of-Stake based Tendermint PBFT consensus engine, staking is integral to ensuring a secure and robust network.

Upon the launch of staking on April 1st, XPRT token holders will be able to delegate their tokens to our network validators for staking. Stakers will receive rewards in the form of XPRT in return for contributing to the security of the network.

> _**The XPRT staking yield for the first year will be 35%+ APR — among the highest in the industry.**_

These lucrative staking rewards incentivize XPRT holders to stake their tokens, thereby increasing network security. Due to high initial rewards, early stakers will be rewarded with the best staking yields.

XPRT is the token around which the entire Persistence ecosystem is built; thus, staking XPRT to secure the chain will also result in a great deal of exposure to multiple dApps in the ecosystem for stakers.

You will be able to stake your XPRT tokens via the [Persistence wallet](https://medium.com/persistence-blog/persistence-xprt-wallet-guide-dbf5e27100f3).

On this screen, you will see your balance, delegated XPRT, and other data at the top of the page. The **staking** page also tracks your wallet balance details. Apart from this, you have 2 tabs in this page:

* **Active**: All active validators are listed here.
* **Inactive**: When validators get jailed for downtime, they are removed from the active validators and listed as inactive.

Only the top validators (50 for core-1), based on the total delegation amount, are active validators. The rest of the active validators, even if not jailed, are moved out as inactive. The inactive validators are in the **Unbonding** or **Unbonded** status.

The **Active** tab displays various active validators, the voting power (based on the number of tokens staked with the validator), commission percentage, validator status, and an **Actions** menu to perform tasks such as:

* Delegate XPRT
* Redelegate XPRT
* Unbond XPRT
* Claim Rewards

#### Step 2: Selecting a Validator <a href="#ed0c" id="ed0c"></a>

Delegate your XPRT tokens to a validator such as Cosmostation, StakeFish, and so on. As you stake your tokens, you can earn rewards too.

Each validator has their voting power, commission rate, status (checkmark means online, x mark means offline). You will want to consider these data points before choosing a validator.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\*r5x1aU56DxIBlCpe)

> _**Note:** Do not delegate to the Foundation nodes. The commission rate for these validators is 100%, meaning you will not receive staking rewards. These are temporary nodes maintained by the Persistence team to contribute to network stability in the initial stage and will be switched off by the end of Q2 2021 or early Q3 2021._

#### Step 3: Delegating <a href="#6301" id="6301"></a>

From the **Staking** page, **Active** tab, select a validator and then select the **Actions** button.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*Hzrt5nRlMhPhkqq7kbQ0Hw.png)

Here you will see the buttons to delegate, redelegate, unbond, or claim rewards.

A window will appear with the validator name, commission percentage, and actions you can perform. Click **Delegate**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1018/1\*sq7bozsIACZVx-fzwvIWIA.png)

In the **Delegate to “VALIDATOR”** window, enter how many XPRT tokens you’d like to delegate to this validator into the “Delegation Amount” field.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1392/1\*8NQHtMhA1aVQquHKGCj5eQ.jpeg)

**Step 3b (Optional)**: Optionally, click **Advanced** and enter your comments or remarks in **Memo.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*L3QIHFucnxByFtqZ6QpW7w.jpeg)

Click **‘Next’**.

#### Step 4: Signing the Delegation Transaction <a href="#74a0" id="74a0"></a>

Once you click “Next”, you will be greeted with this screen to use your KeyStore file password to delegate.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1392/1\*2kQLzeRc1I7YDgJnfq57MA.jpeg)

#### Step 5: Confirmation of Delegation <a href="#cff4" id="cff4"></a>

Once you click “Delegate” you will be shown the transaction hash of your transaction to verify that you have successfully delegated to that validator:

![](https://blog.persistence.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1.png)

You can click the link and view the transaction details or you can review the delegation details under the **Transactions** tab.

Congratulations, you have now successfully delegated to a validator and will begin receiving staking rewards from the network!

> Please note that the unbonding period is 21 days. Once you unbond your XPRT from a validator, you will have to wait 21 days to be able to delegate your tokens again or transfer them.

### **4. Claiming Staking Rewards** <a href="#d39d" id="d39d"></a>

After you delegate your XPRT, you will begin receiving staking rewards. You can claim the rewards from all the validators by using the **Claim** button that is adjacent to the **Rewards** in the wallet details region or you can claim staking rewards from a single validator transaction in the **Staking** page, **Actions** button:

1. Once you’ve clicked **Actions** on the validator you selected, you’ll see this screeen. Select “Claim Rewards”.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1018/1\*rYARhsqwWOaISYe9iNuVng.png)

The value of each XPRT token is indicated in USD. The total available XPRT also is displayed. Click “Next”.

#### Where Can I Find My Claimed Rewards? <a href="#22ed" id="22ed"></a>

You will find your rewards in your delegator wallet. If you’ve set up a different address for withdrawing rewards, for example, your vesting account address, then your rewards are automatically transferred to that address when you claim rewards.

### **5. How to Redelegate to Another Validator** <a href="#b850" id="b850"></a>

> Note: If you have delegated to a Foundation node then you should follow the below steps to redelegate to another validator. Foundation nodes are not meant for delegations and you will not receive staking rewards if delegating to a Foundation node.

After you delegate your XPRT tokens with a validator, at some point you may want to redelegate the XPRT to another validator. You can redelegate the XPRT by selecting the transaction in the **Staking** page:

**1: Click Your Current Validator and “Redelegate”**

From the **Staking** page, **Active or Inactive** tabs, select the validator from whom you want to redelegate and then select the **Actions** button.

**2: Redelegate**

A window appears with the validator name, commission percentage, and actions you can perform. Click **Redelegate**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/976/0\*SZgm5nr8wNh05DJz)

**3: Confirm New Validator and Redelegation Amount**

In the **Redelegate from \<VALIDATOR>** window, select validator name to redelegate the XPRT.

Select your chosen validator and enter the amount of XPRT tokens you wish to delegate to the new validator.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1352/0\*KRpqooY3353Ue0Cp)

**4: Enter Redelegation Amount**

The Delegation Amount is displayed for your reference. Enter the **Redelegation XPRT Amount**. You can’t redelegate more than the delegated amount. If you redelegate a portion of the amount, the remaining XPRT tokens, will be with the initial validator.

**5. Click “Submit”.**

Optionally, click **Advanced** and enter your comments or remarks in **Memo**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*L3QIHFucnxByFtqZ6QpW7w.jpeg)

**6. Click “Next”. Then enter your wallet** **password**.

**7. Click “Redelegate”**

#### Step 4: Confirmation <a href="#ae9e" id="ae9e"></a>

A confirmation message appears after the successful redelegation of the XPRT token. The transaction hash link is provided. You can click the link and view the transaction details or you can review the delegation details under the **Transactions** tab.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1358/0\*M-ydfgcZE-ZsiZnG)

You have now successfully redelegated to another validator!

### **6. How to Unbond XPRT Tokens** <a href="#d798" id="d798"></a>

After you delegate your XPRT tokens, they are in the bonding period of 21 days. You can unbond them earlier by selecting the transaction in the **Active** or **Inactive** Validators tab of the **Staking** page.

1. After selecting the transaction, click **Actions**.
2. In the validator window click **Unbond**.
3. In the **Unbond from \<VALIDATOR>** window, The **Staked Amount** is displayed.

# Why Persistence?

DeFi (decentralized finance) has vastly enhanced opportunities for users across the financial landscape, offering accessible and highly attractive yield-generating vehicles to the majority of the global population through the blockchain. At its peak in November 2021, DeFi [had grown to $240B+ TVL](https://defillama.com/) across various flourishing ecosystems (currently \~$100B).

Before DeFi’s emergence, staking has been a popular yet conservative strategy where users leverage their idle digital assets to earn attractive yields while also providing security to the underlying network. Since its inception, the industry has seen a phenomenal rise in its overall growth, amassing [over $115 billion in current global staked value and 4.8 million stakers worldwide to date](https://www.stakingrewards.com/).

With staking attracting such a large number of participants in their pursuit to earn rewards and provide better network security, significant potential TVL and activity have been siloed away from the DeFi landscape in PoS. Reversely, the emergence of DeFi has highlighted the limited utility that staked assets provide compared to the composability and financial opportunities available in the vibrant DeFi space.

It’s also important to note that PoS chains containing high TVL with a limited amount of staked assets are generally considered to be less secure, while, PoS chains that have high security but lower TVL may be viewed as lacking adoption in the eyes of the public.

Enter liquid staking, enabling a flood of additional liquidity (and users) to enter DeFi by allowing PoS token holders to stake and participate in DeFi at the same time. Liquid stakers receive liquid-staked representative tokens that can be used across DeFi ecosystems, while earning rewards from their underlying staked tokens and supporting the underlying network/s.

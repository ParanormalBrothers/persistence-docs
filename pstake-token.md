# PSTAKE Token

PSTAKE is the governance and incentivization token of the pSTAKE protocol. It is an ERC-20 token and powers the protocol’s ecosystem in the following ways:

**Governance**[**¶**](broken-reference)

PSTAKE holders are incentivised to participate in the protocol’s governance to ensure its long-term success and security by staking PSTAKE on the pSTAKE staking contract. Staking the token would provide its holders with a two-fold benefit, including: \* Participation in protocol improvement proposals through voting. \* Participation in protocol security.

**Incentivization**[**¶**](broken-reference)

In order to ensure long-term success of the protocol, the PSTAKE token will be used to incentivise the core contributors of the pSTAKE ecosystem. PSTAKE will also be used as a dis-incentivization token in case stakeholders staking the token act maliciously or are unable to perform their respective duties appropriately.

**Token Distribution**[**¶**](broken-reference)

The Total Genesis Supply of PSTAKE will be 500,000,000. The distribution is designed to maximize decentralisation of protocol governance, while adequately incentivising the core contributors of the long-term growth of the protocol.

### What is pSTAKE[Â¶](broken-reference) <a href="#what-is-pstake" id="what-is-pstake"></a>

pSTAKE is a liquid staking protocol that unlocks the true potential of staked PoS assets (e.g., ATOM). PoS token holders can stake their tokens onto the pSTAKE platform to mint staked representatives assets called stkASSETs. pSTAKE stakes the underlying deposited PoS tokens with a subset of the validators on each supported chain. stkASSETs, representing the user's staked position, accrue staking rewards in the background, and can be used by users in DeFi to generate additional yield.

pSTAKE currently supports liquid staking for Cosmos, Persistence, Ethereum and BNB chains.

Further details for each of the supported assets can be found in this documentation.

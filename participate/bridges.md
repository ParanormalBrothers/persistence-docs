## IBC

While it's technically not a bridge but an Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol, IBC enables any assets to flow easily between all IBC-enabled blockchains (which Persistence is), via so-called relayers. Find out [here](../build/relayers/ibc-relayers.md) which relayers enable asset flows to and from the Persistence

Find more information on the [IBC Protocol website](https://ibcprotocol.org/) and visualise connections and asset flows easily using the link below:&#x20;

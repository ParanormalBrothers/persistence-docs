# What is Cosmos

[The Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network/) is a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable blockchains, creating the foundation for a new token economy.

Before the Cosmos Network, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small number of transactions per second. Cosmos solves some of the hardest blockchain problems of scalability, usability and interoperability.

[The Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) is a developer-friendly, modular framework, each powered by a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus algorithm such as [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) BFT, allowing developers to fully customize their decentralized applications and focus on business logic.

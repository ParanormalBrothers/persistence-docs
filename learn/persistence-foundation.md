# Persistence Foundation

Persistence Foundation is committed to driving utility for the Persistence ecosystem’s fuel – [XPRT](../participate/xprt/). The foundation will engage with all stakeholders to ensure incentive alignment and direct collective efforts toward the ecosystem vision.

The ultimate goal for the foundation is the welfare of the XPRT holders and Stakers by driving utility for the asset.

## Mandate

* Expand the XPRT holder base through educational and community initiatives&#x20;
* Engage with stakeholders such as market makers, investors, exchanges, etc.&#x20;
* Drive integration of XPRT across [wallets](../participate/wallets.md), [explorers](../participate/explorers.md), and other data-management platforms
* Establish crisis management guidelines for XPRT

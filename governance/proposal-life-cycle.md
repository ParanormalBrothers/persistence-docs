# Proposal Life cycle

All protocol decisions taken through governance are expected to follow a predetermined proposal lifecycle, in order to ensure maximum transparency within the pSTAKE community and maintain consistency. The mentioned lifecycle is also subject to amends through governance, based on community feedback.

* A governance decision is suggested to be discussed on the [pSTAKE forum](https://forum.pstake.finance/) before posting a proposal on pSTAKE Snapshot space.
* Holding such discussion is at the discretion of the author.
* If the author decides to start discussion on the forum, each unique proposal discussion is suggested to have its own thread in order to keep the discussion focused.
* The purpose of these discussions is to capture feedback from the broader pSTAKE community, and refine ideas before formalisation.
* The author is encouraged to address all comments and take feedback into consideration.

Duration : Open ended

#### 2) Formalisation[¶](broken-reference) <a href="#2-formalisation" id="2-formalisation"></a>

After discussion with the community, the post is to be formalised in the form of pSTAKE Improvement Proposal Proposal template: \* **Title** : should include what the proposal is about, and be preceded by _correct proposal number_. \* **Abstract** : a short technical summary that gives a gist of the specifications of the proposal. Abstract could also include a _link_ to _corresponding forum thread_. \* **Motivation** : describing the ‘why’ of the proposal; explaining the problem it solves, the use-case(s), and the benefit it provides to the pSTAKE protocol / stakeholders / underlying networks. \* **Specification** : syntax and semantics of any new feature, or change, at a technical level that is detailed enough to allow implementation by the development team. \* **Considerations** : to discuss the governance and security implications of the proposal \* Governance implications should highlight potential impact on protocol operations/parameters including voting mechanism, protocol revenue streams, treasury, etc. \* Security implications should highlight potential impact on the security of the protocol and the underlying networks, including risks and threats, and how they will be addressed.

#### 3) Snapshot Voting[¶](broken-reference) <a href="#3-snapshot-voting" id="3-snapshot-voting"></a>

* Once the proposal has been formalised, based on the suggested template, it can be posted on the [pSTAKE Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.org/#/pstakefinance.eth).
* Once the proposal is posted, it will go through a **1-Day Voting Delay period** before the voting period starts.
* After the delay period, the proposal will go through a **7-Day Voting Period**, during which all PSTAKE holders will be able to vote (For, Against, or Abstain) on the live proposal.

#### 4) Implementation[¶](broken-reference) <a href="#4-implementation" id="4-implementation"></a>

* If the proposal passes, pSTAKE team will implement the changes proposed, and may reach out to the proposal authors for any assistance if required.
* **Note**: the pSTAKE team holds the right to veto against implementing a passed proposal within **72 hours** after the proposal is passed. The team will thoroughly explain its stance in such scenario in order to maintain full transparency

**Implementation duration** : at least 6 days

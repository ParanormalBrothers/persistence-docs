# Exchange Rate

pSTAKE issues liquid staked stkETH against user’s ETH deposits based on an exchange-rate, inspired by the [Compound’s cToken model](https://compound.finance/docs/ctokens).

The stkETH/ETH exchange rate is determined as follows:

**Exchange rate formula**

Exchange rate = Number of stkETH in supply / (Total ETH staked with pSTAKE + Total ETH Rewards generated by pSTAKE)

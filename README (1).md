# What is Persistence One?

Persistence is a Tendermint-based specialized Layer-1 powering an ecosystem of DeFi dApps focused on unlocking the liquidity of staked assets.

Persistence facilitates the issuance and deployment of liquid-staked stkASSETs, allowing users to earn staking rewards while participating in DeFi primitives, such as lending/borrowing and liquidity provisioning on DEXs.

Persistence aims to offer a seamless staking and DeFi experience for PoS (Proof-of-Stake) users and enable developers to build innovative applications around stkASSETs.

### Internal Products <a href="#1a6e" id="1a6e"></a>

* **pSTAKE:** [pSTAKE](https://pstake.finance/) is a key component of the Persistence ecosystem, enabling liquid staking for users and the issuance of stkASSETs on the Persistence Core chain. We’re committed to continually expanding pSTAKE’s supported assets, thereby continually expanding our addressable market. pSTAKE will continue to drive the expansion of DeFi utility and liquidity of stkASSETs, thereby increasing demand and adoption.
* **AUDIT.one:** Via [AUDIT.one](https://audit.one/), Persistence’s validator arm, we are continuing to become more deeply integrated within, and a critical component of, the overall PoS industry. We aim to reach $2 billion in assets under delegation by Q4 of 2022, while becoming one of the most prominent validators on chains within Cosmos and beyond. Moreover, we’re working towards becoming a node operator for all major (liquid) staking pools in addition to creating a one-stop-shop dashboard for staking & liquid staking.

### Ecosystem Projects <a href="#94f0" id="94f0"></a>

* **Comdex:** Expected to launch their platform on mainnet in Q2 of this year, [Comdex](https://comdex.one/home) is making synthetic commodity assets available to users on the blockchain. Users will have the ability to open collateralized debt positions (CDPs) against stkASSETs to mint cAssets (synthetic commodities), adding more utility to native pSTAKE assets.
* **AssetMantle:** The upcoming mainnet launch of [AssetMantle](https://assetmantle.one/) will enable the minting of inter-chain NFTs and the creation of creator-specific or niche-specific marketplaces. Users will be able to use stkASSETs for the buying and selling of NFTs on supported marketplaces, adding further stkASSET utility.

Each of the applications mentioned above has a direct value-add in terms of increasing utility and adoption of stkASSETs, working in tandem to accelerate us towards our goal of making Persistence the leading liquid staking hub.

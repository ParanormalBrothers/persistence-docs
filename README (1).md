# What is Persistence One?

Persistence is a Tendermint-based specialized Layer-1 powering an ecosystem of DeFi applications focused on unlocking the liquidity of staked assets.

Persistence facilitates the issuance and deployment of liquid-staked stkASSETs, allowing users to earn staking rewards while participating in DeFi primitives, such as lending/borrowing and liquidity provisioning on DEXs.

Persistence aims to offer a seamless staking and DeFi experience for PoS (Proof-of-Stake) users and enable developers to build innovative applications around stkASSETs.

* **pSTAKE:** [pSTAKE](https://pstake.finance/) is a key component of the Persistence ecosystem, enabling liquid staking for users and the issuance of stkASSETs on the Persistence Core chain. We’re committed to continually expanding pSTAKE’s supported assets, thereby continually expanding our addressable market. pSTAKE will continue to drive the expansion of DeFi utility and liquidity of stkASSETs, thereby increasing demand and adoption.
* **AUDIT.one:** Via [AUDIT.one](https://audit.one/), Persistence’s validator arm, we are continuing to become more deeply integrated within, and a critical component of, the overall PoS industry. We aim to become one of the most prominent and secure validators on chains within Cosmos and beyond. Moreover, we’re working towards becoming a node operator for all major (liquid) staking pools in addition to creating a one-stop-shop dashboard for staking & liquid staking.
